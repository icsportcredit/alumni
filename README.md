DEC 28th MEETING
======

Notes: Group shared information regarding presentation that was conducted on DEC 21st (Presentation detail can be found
document DEC21_2012_PRESENTATION).  The information that was shared related to the format of the presentation, length, and details.  It was concluded that the material was extremely relevant to all grades and that the information was tailored well to various groups.  Therefore the consensus is that the presentation should be categorized into three sections focusing on a specific target audience - grade 10, grade 11, and grade 12.  The formats of these categorized presentations will become formal at later communications and as presented by Andrews letter (will discuss later).
